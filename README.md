# C++ Data Structures Examples

This repository contains examples of various data structures implemented in C++. These examples are intended to serve as reference material for the data structures covered in a university course.

## Data Structures Included

1. **Binary Tree**: The `Source.cpp` file in `/binary/tree/` provides an implementation of a binary tree data structure. It includes operations such as insertion and prompts the user for input into the tree structure.

2. **Binary Search**: The `searching_algs.cpp` file in `/hashing_and_search_alg/`. It demonstrates how to perform efficient search operations on sorted arrays using the divide and conquer approach.

3. **Queue**: The `Source.cpp` file in `/queue/` presents an implementation of a queue data structure using arrays or linked lists. It includes operations like enqueue (insertion) and dequeue (deletion) of elements, as well as checking the queue's status (empty or full).

4. **Sorting**: The `Source.cpp` file in `/sorting/` provides examples of using the quicksort searching algorithm. 

5. **Stack**: The `Source1.cpp` file in `/stack/` demonstrates the implementation of a stack data structure using arrays or linked lists. It includes operations like push (insertion), pop (deletion), and checking if the stack is empty.

## Getting Started

To use these examples, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can clone this repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/sptallent/data-structures-cpp.git
```

Once cloned, you can navigate to the respective files to study and experiment with the data structures and algorithms provided.
